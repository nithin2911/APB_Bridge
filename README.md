## UVM based Verification & Physical Design of APB Protocol ####

#### Introduction ####

This project aims to verify the RTL code associated with APB Bridge using Universal Verification Methodology and obtaining Physcial Design for the same.  
The project has two parts:  
1. Verification of APB bridge interface using UVM, which includes Monitor, Driver, Sequencer & Scoreboard, until the top test environment.
2. Obtaining Physical Design of the APB Bridge design code and generating the area, timing reportscfor the same.
   
This project was originally coded using System Verilog and complied/simulated using Cadence Xcelium Logic Simulator.
